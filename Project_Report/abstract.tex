The competitive landscape of recruitment requires candidates to possess not only strong technical skills but also effective communication and problem-solving abilities. Traditional interview preparation methods often lack personalized feedback and real-time interaction. To address this gap, we present \textbf{AceIt}, an AI-powered personalized interview preparation platform.

AceIt leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google Gemini, to simulate realistic interview scenarios. The platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including an AI-driven mock interview system that adapts questions based on user responses and resume content, a coding practice arena with an intelligent AI tutor, and a resume analyzer that provides Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility scores.

Key features include multi-modal analysis (text and audio) for interviews, real-time code debugging and optimization suggestions, and detailed performance analytics. The system allows users to practice technical, HR, and behavioral questions in a stress-free environment, receiving instant, constructive feedback. By integrating these features into a unified web application using React and FastAPI, AceIt provides a holistic solution for students and job seekers to enhance their employability and confidence.
