\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{AceIt} successfully demonstrates the potential of AI in transforming interview preparation. By integrating advanced LLMs with a robust web architecture, the platform provides a personalized, interactive, and scalable solution for job seekers. The system effectively addresses the lack of feedback in traditional preparation methods and offers a safe environment to practice and improve.

The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future upgrades. The use of React and FastAPI ensures a modern, high-performance user experience. Initial testing indicates that the AI-driven features (Tutor, Interviewer) significantly enhance engagement and learning outcomes compared to static resources.
