--- STARTING VERIFICATION ---
1. Creating dummy session for user: test_user_persistence_verify
   Saved session to d:/AceIt/aceit_backend/data/interview_sessions.json

   NOTE: If the backend is already running, it might not see this file change instantly
   unless the singleton is re-instantiated or I implemented a reload mechanism.
   Let's check if it picks it up (if the singleton initialization happens per request or if I restart).
2. Check analytics for user: test_user_persistence_verify
   [FAIL] API Error: 500 - {"detail":"Failed to generate analytics: 'str' object has no attribute 'isoformat'"}

[WARNING] Verification checks failed or data not picked up.
This might be because the server didn't reload or the user ID didn't match.
