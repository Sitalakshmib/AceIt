--- STARTING VERIFICATION ---
1. Creating dummy session for user: test_user_persistence_verify
   Saved session to d:/AceIt/aceit_backend/data/interview_sessions.json

   NOTE: If the backend is already running, it might not see this file change instantly
   unless the singleton is re-instantiated or I implemented a reload mechanism.
   Let's check if it picks it up (if the singleton initialization happens per request or if I restart).
2. Check analytics for user: test_user_persistence_verify
   Analytics Response Received:
   - Has Data: True
   - Technical Sessions: 4
   - Average Score: 83.3

[SUCCESS] Verification Passed! Persistence is working.
